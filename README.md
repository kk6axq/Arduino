Arduino Impostor
========
* This is NOT the REAL Arduino. 
* 
* Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple i/o
board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring
language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or
can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).
The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source
IDE can be downloaded for free.

* For more information, see the website at: http://www.arduino.org/
or the forums at: null

* To report a *bug* in the software or to request *a simple enhancement* go to:
http://github.com/arduino-org/Arduino/issues

* More complex requests and technical discussion should go on the Arduino Developers
mailing list:
sorry we don't have one yet...

* If you're interested in modifying or extending the Arduino software, we strongly 
suggest discussing your ideas on the Developers mailing list *before* starting
to work on them. That way you can coordinate with the Arduino Team and others,
giving your work a higher chance of being integrated into the official release

This impostor version of Arduino is an open source(not really) project, supported by many.

The Arduino team is composed of (your name here).

Arduino uses the [GNU avr-gcc toolchain](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/avr-gcc), [avrdude](http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/), [avr-libc](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/), and code from
[Processing](http://www.processing.org) and [Wiring](http://wiring.org.co).
